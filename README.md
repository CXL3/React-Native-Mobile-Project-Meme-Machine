# React-Native-Mobile-Project-Meme-Machine

This is a react native app. It is all about Meme. You can browse memes/ upload meme, add comments, upvote/downvote, login/signup and share button.

I used the following:

- React stack/drawer navigation

- Redux for React Native

- { Card, Button, Input, Icon } from "react-native-elements";

- { FlatList, StyleSheet, View, Text, Share, ScrollView, Alert, Modal } from "react-native";
- ImagePicker from "expo-image-picker"
- json-server
- SafeAreaView and platform
